    "cymr, an implementation of the Context Maintenance and Retrieval (CMR) model, leverages Cython for faster execution compared to base Python. While Cython's speedup is essential given CMR's computational demands, its specialized syntax and concepts present a barrier for users or contributors unfamiliar with low-level programming languages or preferring regular Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook highlights the substantial speedup Cython offers for cymr operations. However, it also demonstrates an alternative method to achieve these gains using Numba, a tool that compiles Python functions \"just in time\" into optimized machine code. Unlike Cython, Numba doesn't demand specialized syntax or additional compilation steps, making it more accessible to users with different skill levels. Even for experienced Cython users, Numba might be easier to use and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus here is on the function `integrate_context` from `cymr`'s operations.pyx, with a direct comparison of Cython and Python versions, and the application of Numba's `@njit` decorator to the Python translation. The results reveal that Numba-compiled Python code is substantially faster than both Cython and base Python versions, proving that Numba is a promising alternative to Cython for CMR. Thus, Numba can enhance speed while avoiding Cython's accessibility challenges."
